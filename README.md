# K-Point_Crossover_Genetic_Algorithm


# The idea of this programme is to solve a mixed integer programming optimization problem using GA Algorithm.

# With this programme, even if it's a totally different question, the user only needs to change the parameters under the
# section GA parameters. There is no need to change anything in the other parts of the code. This makes the programme
# more user-friendly for people who do not have background in coding and is more susceptible for future use.
