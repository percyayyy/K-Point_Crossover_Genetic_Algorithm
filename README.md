# K-Point_Crossover_Genetic_Algorithm


(1) Introduction

The idea of this programme is to solve a mixed integer programming optimization problem (refer to section 2) using Genetic Algorithm.

With this programme, even if it's a totally different question, the user only needs to change the parameters under the
section GA parameters. There is no need to change anything in the other parts of the code. This makes the programme
more user-friendly for people who do not have a background in coding and is more susceptible for future use.


(2) The specific problem this programme solves

There are 7 items with the following values and weights. Assume that a container has the capacity of 120KG. What is the max value of items in the container? 

Item#   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Value   30  60  25  8   10  40  60
Weight  40  40  30  5   15  35  30
